ðŸš€ Exploratory Data Analysis: Red Wine Quality Dataset

I recently completed a mini EDA project using the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle. This project involved data cleaning, handling missing values and duplicates, along with optional steps like outlier treatment and encoding.

Through this project, I gained insights into how chemical properties affect wine quality. You can find the full analysis and visualizations in the comment section.

ðŸ“Œ Check out my project link in the comments!
Open to feedback and discussion :)
